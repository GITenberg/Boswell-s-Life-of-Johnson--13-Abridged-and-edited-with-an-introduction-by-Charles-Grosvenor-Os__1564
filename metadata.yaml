description: "The Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D. (1791) is a biography of Dr. Samuel\
  \ Johnson written by James Boswell. The work was a popular and critical success\
  \ when first published. It is regarded as an important stage in the development\
  \ of the modern genre of biography; many have claimed it as the greatest biography\
  \ written in English, but some modern critics object that the work cannot be considered\
  \ a proper biography. While Boswell's personal acquaintance with his subject only\
  \ began in 1763, when Johnson was 54 years old, Boswell covered the entirety of\
  \ Johnson's life by means of additional research. The biography takes many critical\
  \ liberties with Johnson's life, as Boswell makes various changes to Johnson's quotations\
  \ and even censors many comments. Nonetheless, modern biographers have found Boswell's\
  \ biography an important source of information on Johnson and his times.\n From\
